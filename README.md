# STOCK TREND PREDICTION

For the prediction the Deep Learning model which we used is LSTM there is a pretrained model is given but if you want you can train the model by yourself with the "LSTM_model.ipynb" file. Based on 100 days moving average we will try to predict the closing price of the stock market. We are not saying that one should perform trading based on this model.This is just a learning project and there is not any rocket science envolve in it which will make you billionaire in a day. It will give you just a inituition about how things work.
